## Architecture

This repository contains the privacy policies for two Chrome extensions:

1.  **PromptMiner**: A tool for managing prompts. The privacy policy emphasizes that all data is stored locally on the user's browser and is never sent to any servers.
2.  **WeChat Article Reading Assistant**: An extension to enhance the reading experience of WeChat articles. Its privacy policy also states that all data processing happens locally in the browser, and no personal information or browsing data is collected.

Both extensions are designed with a strong focus on user privacy, with all user data being stored and processed locally.
